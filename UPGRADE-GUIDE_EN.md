## Fix PWA Service Worker Warnings (v1.2.67)

```

## Fix Image Size Issues in Lighthouse

If your Lighthouse report shows large unoptimized images, this means that automatic image preview generation is not working.

## Solution

Update to version **1.2.6** or higher:

```bash
npm update core-maugli
```

After updating automatically:

1. âœ… Preview generation scripts will be copied to your project
2. âœ… Build process will be updated to include preview generation
3. âœ… Version in package.json will be updated

## Verification

After updating, check your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node scripts/generate-previews.js && astro build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "core-maugli": "^1.2.6"
  }
}
```

## Run Preview Generation

Now optimized previews (400x210px) will be automatically created for all blog images during each build.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Result

After this, your blog images will:

- âš¡ Load faster
- ðŸ“± Display correctly on all devices
- ðŸŸ¢ Get high scores in Lighthouse
